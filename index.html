            <p>In 1970, only 2 of the 12 animals you explored today were considered endangered or threatened. In recent years, that number has increased greatly. As you explored the animals and their fascinating qualities through this website, I hope this chart encourages one to think about how to help the habitats and wellbeing of these animals.</p>
